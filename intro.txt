1) components are very useful for some specific usecases where we have some block of code which we want
to use multiple times in project it incress reusablity

2) we can create seprate component for a codes which work sapratly and can use it in many places

3) components aslo very usefull to splliting your big app in small and reusable chunks

4) component is just like custom html element which has it's own feactures and funcanalitys 

5) you should try to name component in 2 or multiple words with - in between and not use built in tags names 
   because all built in html tags are single word so by this we will not clash with any built in ones.

6) a vue component is just another app which belongs to some app so we can use all things we do in 
vue.createApp() conf

7) components allow to encapsulate peace of code with html, data and other confs

8) everytime you use any component vue will create saprate instance of that component just we create instance of class
so like in class every object can hold saprate value for data and other things in components also every instance of component will
hold diffrent value for all data and other propertyes so when we change any property of spacific instance of component it will affect to
that component only.
