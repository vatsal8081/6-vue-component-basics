            <!-- hear we can reuse component as many time as we want  inside app where we register it-->
            <!-- just keep in mind every created component is just like instance of class so it will
            have different values for different data and work individually-->
            <!-- you can tell it by clicking on show more and it will only true isShowMore of that
            component only and only show more details about that component other will stay false-->

            <!-- 3 -->
            <!-- when you design component keep in mind that where you add component that place
            will replace by the html provided in component so design it by keep in mind that-->
            <!-- like hear we use ul in main app and provide li in component to create separate
            list items inside ul  -->
        </ul>

        <!-- 4 as you can see this way if creating component will be vary difficult and 
        also provide html in string and creating components in one file not a good idea 
        so we will use other way for it in next module-->
